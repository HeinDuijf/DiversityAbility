    "This jupyter notebook demonstrates how the agent-based model (ABM) of group decision-making by walking you through the stages of the model. The idea is that the group faces a binary choice problem and each individual has access to a number of imperfect sources to guide their individual decision-making. The main components of the agent-based model are: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sources.** Each ABM consists of a set of sources. Each source has a certain reliability (typically, $\\geq 0.5$), which represents the probability that it produces evidence that supports the correct alternative.  \n",
    "2. **Agents.** Each agent in the ABM is connected to a number of sources, which determine the agent's decisions. The basic idea is that agents follow the majority of the evidences available to them. \n",
    "3. **Teams.** A team is a set of agents. The team decision-making follows the majority rule, so that the team picks the alternative that most team members think is best. \n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, an instantiation of the agent-based model, called `Community`, consists of the following building blocks:\n",
    "- A set of sources $S$,\n",
    "- For each source $s \\in S$:\n",
    "    - Its reliability $p_s$\n",
    "- A set of agents $N$,\n",
    "- For each agent $i \\in N$:\n",
    "    - A set of sources $S_i \\subseteq S$ that she has access to. \n",
    "\n",
    "In future work, I plan to also include more complicated versions of group decision-making (other than majority rule) by including influence networks. "
