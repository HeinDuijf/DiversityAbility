    "# Diversity and Expertise\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates how the agent-based model (ABM) of group decision-making works by walking you through the stages of the team’s collective decision-making. The idea is that the team faces a binary choice problem and each individual has access to a number of imperfect sources to guide their individual decision-making. The model assumes that one of the two options is objectively or intersubjectively correct. The main components of the agent-based model are: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sources.** Each ABM consists of a set of sources and their reliabilities. Each source has a certain reliability (typically, $\\geq 0.5$), which represents the probability that it produces evidence that supports the correct alternative.  \n",
    "2. **Agents.** Each agent in the ABM is represented by their heuristic, which is modelled as the sources she has access to. Agents form their opinions by adopting the majority rule. The basic idea is that agents follow the majority of the evidences available to them. \n",
    "3. **Teams.** A team is a set of agents. The teams communicate internally before forming a collective decision. We consider three deliberative mechanisms:\n",
    "   1. Opinion-based dynamics: agents communicate their opinion (not the underlying evidences) and the team’s collective decision follows the majority *opinion*.\n",
    "   2. Evidence-based dynamics: agents communicate all their evidences and the team’s collective decision follows the majority *evidence*.\n",
    "   3. Boundedly rational evidence-based dynamics: agents communicate all their evidences and the team’s collective decision follows the majority *evidence*—possibly with double counting.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, an given team, implemented by the class `Team`, consists of the following building blocks:\n",
    "- A set of sources and their (heterogeneous) reliabilities, implemented by the class `Sources`.\n",
    "- A set of agents and their heuristics (i.e., sets of sources that they have access to, one for each agent), implemented by the class `Agent`.   "
