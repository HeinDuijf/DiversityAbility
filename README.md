# Majority Voting
This project concerns some agent-based models and simulations of majority voting. The 
main goal is to investigate under which conditions majority voting succeeds in 
selecting the alternative that is in the best interest of the majority. 

## Setup
To run the simulations and generate the data, just run the script

```commandline
python main.py
```

This will create a csv file `data/clean.csv` and a folder `data/communities`.

To run the statistical analysis, run the notebook XXX. 

## Organization

### Community
The central class `Community` is defined in `community.py`. A `Community` consists 
of a network of agents, and it can be used to compute the estimated accuracy of a given 
community. The networks are generated with homophilic and preferential attachment. 

### Data
The data is generated using methods in `generate_data.py`. The communities in the 
folder `data/communities` are generated by `generate_communities` and the csv 
file `data/clean.csv` is created by `process_communities_to_csv` on the basis of these 
communities.
